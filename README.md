A Mastercard Foundation AfOx Scholar at the University of Oxford. 
I am pursuing an MSc in [International Health and Tropical Medicine (IHTM)](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/msc-ihtm) at the Nuffield Department of Medicine as a member of St Edmund Hall.

I am keen on sustainable solutions to fundamental health issues such as research capacity; vaccine development,
manufacturing, and sustainable funding models to guarantee access and equity;
and universal health coverage (UHC), which I consider critical to combating the increasing risk and emergence of zoonotic diseases and achieving resilient and adaptable healthcare. 

I am currently learning R for reproducible research and I'm happy to [connect](mailto:kareemadinah@gmail.com) with you.ðŸ’ŒðŸ˜‰
